This is the UI using Shiny of the wikipedia.de that was used in the PPTAM paper.

8/7/2020  'ShinyPPTAMtabsWorking9.R' is the calling program.  'PolygonSource_working2.R' is the subroutine.  The data is in the PPTAM_EXT folder (which is in the other folder in this Github account.  This program computes the numbers for the polygon and I'm using 'wikipedia-profile-de.csv' for the user requests.  This is a workaround in order to compute the scale factor.
